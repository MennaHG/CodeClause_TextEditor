reactive: developing for all variations. Investment risk if future dont aligb with assumed reqs
proactive: if reuse opportunity arises caan be costly if no inital baseline is available
extractive: reuses some operationall software products to make inital baseline. if orh hav expertise and artifacts in domain

Factors: Legal ,managerial,economic,technicnal

- Sucess Factors: ensure management undeestand reuse, develop software by product line approach, support reuse by tools, perform domain modelling of reusable comps

- Domain Analysis: define related products from the very begining of SWD process.

- Product families: product-based dev to  product-line dev
- FODA to define commonality and variablity
